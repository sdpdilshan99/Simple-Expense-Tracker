# 🎉 React Frontend

A frontend application built using **React.js**. This project serves as the user interface for interacting with a backend API (e.g., SpendWise). It provides a smooth and responsive UI to manage transactions, track income and expenses, and categorize them using tags.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ User-friendly interface for managing transactions
- 📊 View income and expenses in an organized manner
- 🏷️ Add, edit, and assign tags to transactions
- 🔄 Real-time data fetching from the backend API
- 🎨 Responsive design with modern UI/UX principles

## 📦 Tech Stack

- React.js
- React Router (for routing)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- CSS (or any other styling library like Sass or Tailwind)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the frontend project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-frontend.git
cd react-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure environment variables, such as the API endpoint:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

You can replace the `REACT_APP_API_URL` with the actual backend URL if your API is hosted elsewhere.

## ▶️ Running the Application

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the app will be available at:

👉 **http://localhost:3000**

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the tests for the frontend, use:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run unit tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

---

## 🚧 Build for Production

To create an optimized build for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build/` directory containing the production-ready files.

---

## 🔄 API Integration

This project communicates with the backend API (e.g., **SpendWise**) to fetch and manage transactions.

Here are some example API endpoints you might be interacting with:

- **GET /api/transactions**: Fetch all transactions
- **POST /api/transactions**: Add a new transaction
- **PUT /api/transactions/:id**: Edit an existing transaction
- **DELETE /api/transactions/:id**: Delete a transaction

You can customize this based on your actual API endpoints.
